# Portfolio

 <p>This portfolio is to demonstrate my abilities as a full-stack software engineer. This portfolio was built from scratch without using a template.
  For now, this portfolio is hosted on Firebase and does not include a backend. I do plan on making this portfolio a full-stack application
  I plan on hosting the backend server on some AWS EC2 instance and using a database like DynamoDB to host my projects.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun building out this project. I used Angular 14 for my front-end framework as I am more familiar with it compared to React.
    I made this application with a desktop-first approach mainly because this portfolio is meant to reach hiring managers or anyone of interest in doing
    business with. To save space for deployment, I did not load all images locally but rather in a AWS S3 bucket.
    This portfolio was built from scratch. I could of used a template to project but I wanted to practice some more angular concepts like the @ViewChild and
    @Hostlistener practices and using the inject function instead of the constructor for dependency injection. This project was a learning experience and I am glad
    that I have built a solid foundation for it</p>
